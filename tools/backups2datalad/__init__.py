IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT GITHUB CREDENTIALS

This script interacts with the GitHub API (in order to create & configure
repositories), and so it requires a GitHub OAuth token stored in the global Git
config under `hub.oauthtoken`.  In addition, the script also pushes commits to
GitHub over SSH, and so an SSH key that has been registered with a GitHub
account is needed as well.

Maybe TODO:
    - do not push in here, push will be outside upon success of the entire hierarchy

Later TODOs

- become aware of superdataset, add new subdatasets if created and ran
  not for a specific subdataset
- parallelize across datasets or may be better files (would that be possible within
  dataset?) using DataLad's #5022 ConsumerProducer?
